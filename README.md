Automatically count colonies from a photo of your Petri dish. Available here: https://zznidar.github.io/colony-counter/  

Tired of counting colonies of bacteria manually? Just take a photo, adjust some parameters (hopefully AI wil be able to do this automatically soon) and read the result :)  

A prototype.
