# colony-counter
Automatically count colonies from a photo of your Petri dish. Available here: https://zznidar.github.io/colony-counter/  

Tired of counting colonies of bacteria manually? Just take a photo, adjust some parameters (hopefully AI wil be able to do this automatically soon) and read the result :)  

A prototype.

## How to use
1. Pick a photo of your Petri dish.
2. Play with sliders to adjust settings.  

Red colour represents areas of colonies. Blue squares show the centre of each colony. Count is shown below the image.
